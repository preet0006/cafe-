//note these are the inital thoughts written before desing and everthing

<!-- 5 pages homepage booking page menu show page contact page about us page

Nav and  footer almost in all the pages 

all images are stored locally automatically increase bundle size impact performance but that's not a problem right now

Homepage=> hero cards another section showcasing reviews 

About us page contact details single component 
swiper library to show text and image 
Reusable component card used in all almost all pages 
 
Table booking page  reusable card on top location of restaurant details and the images
React picker used for calendar and data shows dynamically for sections according to the value in usestate

Fixed data comes from utils



For perfomance optimization
could have use webp images types add cdn add priority to images and video on homepage . Low quality photos to  mobile  or 
lazy loading  react compiler is there  so memoization of components not required but thats not the task or priority right now
